security group:-
         A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach leave the resources that it is associated with.
         for example: after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound rules and outbound rules traffic for the instance,
                      it comes a default security group
Load balancer:- 
            it is servers as the single point of contact for clients. the load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets,such as EC2instances,
             in multiple availability zones. this increases the availability of your application.
    
Load balancer types:
1- application load balancer: 
      An apllication load balancer makes routing decisions at the application layer(HTTP/HTTPS),
      supports path-based routing,and can route requests to one or more ports on each container instance in your cluster.
     application load balancers support dynamic host port mapping.
2- network load balancer:-
   A network load balancer makes routing decisions at the transport layer(TCP/SSL).it can handle millions of request per second.after the load balancer receives a connection,
   it selects a target group for the default rule using a flow hashrouting algorithm.
    network lb support dynamic host port mapping .
3- classic load balancer:-
     it provides basic load balancing across multiple amazon EC2 instances and operates at both the request level and connection level.
     clb is intended for applications that are built within the EC2 classic network . 

S3(SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE):
    it is an object storage service that stores data as objects with in buckets an object is a file and any metadata that describes the fike. A bucket is a container for objects.
    to store your data in amazon s3.you first create a ucket and specify a bucket name and aws region.
 using: store and retrieve any amount of data at any time,from anywhere
